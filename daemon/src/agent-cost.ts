// What one agent actually costs this machine, measured rather than assumed.
//
// MEASURED_AGENT_COST in daemon/src/capacity.ts is the whole cap in two
// numbers, and KAN-34 shipped them from a single afternoon's observation with
// a note saying "re-measure it before trusting it". This is that instrument —
// extracted from scripts/measure-agent-cost.mjs (KAN-55) so the daemon can run
// the same measurement the script runs, with exactly one copy of the logic.
// The script is now a thin CLI over this module.
//
// An agent is not the `claude` process. It is that process plus everything it
// starts — tsc, npm, git, ripgrep, subagents — and the cost that matters is
// the whole tree's. So the tree is what is measured: every process is grouped
// under the nearest `claude` ancestor that has no `claude` ancestor of its
// own, and CPU is summed per group.
//
// CPU is measured as cores, not as a load average: utime+stime deltas from
// /proc/<pid>/stat divided by wall-clock seconds. That is the quantity the
// machine actually spends. The load average, reported alongside it, is the
// queue that quantity produces — the number the human feels, and always the
// larger of the two once the machine is contended.
