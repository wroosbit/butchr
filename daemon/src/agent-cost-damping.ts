// Believing a measurement, carefully: the damping between what agent-cost.ts
// samples and what capacity.ts divides by.
//
// The instantaneous reading must never reach the arithmetic, because the two
// mistakes it invites are not the same size. Believe too quickly that agents
// are cheap — one idle minute while the whole fleet waits on an API — and the
// cap opens to a fleet the machine cannot carry the moment they all wake,
// which is exactly the desktop-killing incident (KAN-34) this file descends
// from. Believe too slowly that agents are expensive and the only cost is a
// refused activation, which the operator can read, override, or wait out. So
// the filter is asymmetric on purpose: quick to believe an agent is
// expensive, slow to believe it is cheap.
//
// The shape is an EWMA with a per-direction alpha, chosen over a
// high-water-mark window because it needs no history buffer, degrades to
// nothing when the sampler stops feeding it, and its step response is easy to
// state (and is stated, and proved in verify-agent-capacity.mjs sections
// 10–13): at ALPHA_UP = 0.5 a step up is ~87% believed after three windows;
// at ALPHA_DOWN = 0.1 a step down needs ~22 windows to be 90% believed. With
// the daemon's 60-second window that is minutes to charge more and the better
// part of half an hour to charge less — the fast direction protects the
// human, the slow one merely delays an optimism.
//
// Everything here is pure. The state (the previous estimate) belongs to the
// caller — the daemon's sampler loop — so the arithmetic can be driven
// through step responses in a script without a daemon, a clock, or /proc.
