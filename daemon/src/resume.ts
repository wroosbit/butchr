/**
 * Bringing an agent back after the machine died under it.
 *
 * Re-spawning is the easy half. The half that KAN-21 was actually about is
 * that an agent which comes back with no instruction *idles forever*, and that
 * this looks identical to an agent that has finished. Both of the paths below
 * therefore end with the agent being told, in words, that it was interrupted
 * and what to do about it.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, because the ticket's premise turned out to be wrong
 *
 * Claude Code 2.1.220 was tested on this host in a real PTY. Its transcript
 * (`~/.claude/projects/<mangled cwd>/<sessionId>.jsonl`) is written *eagerly*,
 * per event; it survives SIGKILL with no shutdown hook; a deliberately torn
 * final record still resumes; and `--continue` restores the prior turns.
 * `--continue` against a directory with genuinely no history exits 1 with
 * "No conversation found to continue", which is what makes the launcher's
 * `||` fallback correct.
 *
 * So conversation restoration was never the broken part. The two things that
 * genuinely stop an unattended resume are handled here and in launchers.ts:
 * the resume modal (see RESUME_ENV) and the missing instruction (see below).

/**
 * Environment that keeps a resume from stopping to ask a question nobody is
 * there to answer.
 *
 * Claude Code offers "Resume from summary / Resume full session as-is / Don't
 * ask me again" when a resumed conversation is **both** older than
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` (default 70) **and** larger than
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_RESUME_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` (default 100000). That is the exact
 * profile of a task agent that has been working all afternoon — which is why
 * it was hit twice on the day this ticket was written, and never by a fresh
 * agent. Unattended, the modal is a hang: the pane sits on a menu until a human
 * happens to look.
 *
 * Both thresholds are read from the environment by the CLI itself, so raising
 * them past any real conversation is a supported configuration rather than a
 * trick. The consequence is deliberate and worth stating: suppressing the
 * prompt means always taking the "full session" branch, which is the more
 * expensive of the two. For an unattended agent that is the right default —
 * its context is the thing being restored — but it is a real cost, not a free
 * win.
