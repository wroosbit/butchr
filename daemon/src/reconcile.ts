 * This is the step that did not exist. On KAN-21's outage the daemon restarted
 * (eventually), herdr restarted, and neither of them had any opinion about the
 * two agents that had been working ninety seconds earlier — because nothing had
 * written down that they existed. With the registry doing that, restoration is
 * this file: read the intent, ask herdr what is really there, and start what is
 * missing.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE BROWSER, which is the point. Activation was already
 * a daemon-side operation that the extension merely *calls*; the extension
 * never owned the lifecycle, it triggered it. So restoration can go through the
 * very same `handleActivateByKey` a sidepanel toggle uses, with no tab, no
 * sidepanel and nobody logged in.
