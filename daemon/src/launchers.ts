// no key but this workspace's. The trust check walks parent directories, so
// trusting workDir also covers the git worktree the agent clones inside it.
//
// The write is racing Claude Code itself, and that fact picked the mechanism
// (KAN-54). Live incident, 2026-08-02: four story agents activated within ~7s;
// the last one's trust entry was missing from ~/.claude.json when its claude
// booted, and it sat wedged on the trust dialog behind a `success: true,
// verified: true` answer. Two candidate writers were named and tested:
//
//   1. A second briefly-coexisting daemon (the connectToDaemon spawn race in
//      ipc.ts). Ruled out structurally: the loser daemon hits EADDRINUSE,
//      probes the winner's socket and exits *without ever listening*
//      (daemon.ts), and boot restoration — its only write path to this file —
//      runs in onListen. A daemon that never serves never writes.
//
//   2. The spawned `claude` processes themselves. Reproduced with the real
//      binary on 2026-08-02: claude reads ~/.claude.json at boot and writes
//      the whole file back from memory moments later; a trust entry injected
//      between that read and write-back (t+0.45s into boot, present on disk at
//      t+0.47s) was gone at t+0.48s and stayed gone. A sibling booting for an
//      earlier workspace erases entries written after its read — the incident
//      shape exactly, down to the *last*-activated workspace being the victim.
//
// So the racing writer lives in another process, and the rejected alternative
// follows: an in-daemon mutex or per-file promise chain serialises only this
// daemon, which — initPty being synchronous end-to-end — already cannot
// interleave with itself. What works against an external rewriter is what this
// function does: write atomically (temp-then-rename in the same directory, so
// a mid-write reader never parses a torn file), then re-read after a settle
// delay and repair a clobbered entry, bounded, and report failure instead of
// letting the caller spawn an agent into an untrusted folder. The residual
// window — a sibling's write-back landing after the last verify here but
// before the new claude reads the file — closes at the pre-spawn re-check
// (herdr.ts) and cannot be closed entirely from this side of the spawn;
// KAN-49 explicitly defers watching agents past their startup dialogs.
